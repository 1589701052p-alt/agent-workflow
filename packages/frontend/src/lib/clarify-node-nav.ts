// RFC-161 — task-detail canvas clarify-node click target.
//
// Clicking a clarify / cross-clarify node on the task-status canvas opens the
// clarify page (`/clarify/$nodeRunId`) instead of the (near-empty)
// NodeDetailDrawer. This pure helper picks WHICH node_run to route to — and
// whether the node is clickable at all — from the backend-stamped
// `clarifyNavKind` (services/task.ts getTaskNodeRuns).
//
// All clarify semantics — "has a resolvable round" (never route to a 404),
// awaiting-vs-answered, orphaned-awaiting suppression on a dead task — live in
// the backend oracle. This helper is a PURE freshest-run orchestrator, the same
// shape as deriveReviewNodeNav (review-node-nav.ts): the node's current state is
// its ULID-newest run; we read that one run's stamp. An OLDER answered/awaiting
// run must NOT shadow a newer non-clickable one (a persistent-stop guard run or a
// canceled round), and a stale orphaned awaiting must NOT be reached past a newer
// null run — freshest-run is immune to both because it only ever reads the current
// run's stamp (design §2.3, resolved across the design-gate rounds).
//
// Unlike deriveReviewNodeNav this does NOT filter to top-level runs: a sharded
// self-clarify's shard sessions are legitimate click targets and may carry a
// parentNodeRunId; the backend clarifyNavKind stamp (null for non-session runs) is
// the safety gate.
//
// ULID id order (later-minted row wins) mirrors the backend's isFresherNodeRun
// comparator; a clarify run's `startedAt` is the createClarifySession mint tick and
// is monotonic with the ULID, so ULID-newest and the canvas' startedAt-latest agree.
