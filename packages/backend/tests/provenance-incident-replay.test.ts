// RFC-074 incident `01KSHVXCH6RQ5F5P64MZ4FZVN6` replay — provenance resolution.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS (regression intent):
//   The user approved a review (v2, whose CONTENT had been refreshed to the
//   agent's latest output) and 18ms later a SECOND awaiting_review row appeared
//   forcing re-approval of the very same content. Root cause (proposal §1.2):
//   the review row's denormalized `clarifyIteration` watermark stuck at the
//   iterate-time value while its doc_version content was refreshed underneath
//   it; the Layer-B freshness invariant then compared the STALE watermark
//   against the agent's higher cci and judged the approval stale → spurious
//   re-review.
//
//   PR-A locked the buggy behavior through the actual (now-deleted) mechanism
//   (`applyClarifyFreshnessInvariant` + `isReviewClarifyAlignedWithUpstream`).
//   RFC-074 retired BOTH the Layer-B invariant AND the cci watermark: freshness
//   is now decided by PROVENANCE — `isNodeRunFresh` compares the run id the
//   review actually consumed against the upstream's current freshest done row.
//   This file is re-expressed against that mechanism:
//     A18 — review consumed the agent's freshest done run → fresh → NO spurious
//           re-review (the bug is structurally impossible; §1.3).
//     A19 — review consumed an OLDER run while the agent produced a newer done
//           run → stale → re-review fires (RFC-005 US-2 preserved).
//     A20 — multi-upstream: stale on ANY consumed upstream ⟹ re-review.
//   The "denormalized watermark" can no longer desync because there is exactly
//   one freshness source of truth (the consumed-run id), recorded at the single
//   content read-point.
