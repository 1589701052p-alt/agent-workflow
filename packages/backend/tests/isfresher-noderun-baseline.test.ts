// RFC-074 PR-C — `isFresherNodeRun` pure-id ordering, locked case-by-case.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS (regression intent):
//   This file began life as the PR-A EQUIVALENCE BASELINE for the retirement
//   of the scalar `clarifyIteration` (cci) watermark. PR-A locked the old
//   3-level `(cci desc, retryIndex desc, id desc)` comparator so PR-C could
//   prove the switch to pure `id` ordering picks the SAME row on every
//   causally-minted set (plan T-C1 / AC §11.3 C1-C4).
//
//   PR-C has now landed: `isFresherNodeRun` is pure `candidate.id > incumbent.id`
//   (design §6.1). This file is migrated to lock that production behavior and to
//   document — on the very sets PR-A flagged — WHY pure-id is equivalent in the
//   field: under causal minting every rerun (clarify / cross-clarify / process
//   retry) is inserted AFTER the rows it supersedes, so it carries the largest
//   ULID. The cci layer was redundant with that invariant.
//
//   A6 keeps the load-bearing equivalence anchor: on causal-order ids the three
//   candidate pickers (old comparator, pure-id, retry-then-id) agree. A6b keeps
//   the adversarial boundary — the ONLY shape where pure-id would diverge from
//   the retired comparator (a stale low-cci row minted with a LARGER id) — and
//   records why that shape is unreachable in production: reruns are always
//   minted later, and freshness is now ultimately decided by provenance
//   (`isNodeRunFresh` consumed-run id), not by this comparator alone.
//
//   If this file goes RED again, that is a SIGNAL to re-audit §6.1, not a
//   licence to edit the expectations.
